# Starcraft-2-Trainer

A trainer app for Starcraft 2. Import your replay, and sc2trainer will rate you on how good your macro abilities were.

## Scoring

The program yields a score between 0-100000 which incorporates how well you followed your build order of choice, how often you were supply capped, and how often you were hoarding resources.

## Additional output

The program can also be tweaked to let you know at what timestamp your macro was off, and what you can improve. See the commented print statements in the source.
